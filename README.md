# Little-Taco-Shop-CSS-Project
I built the Little Taco Shop website using HTML and CSS, applying various properties to create a visually appealing and structured layout. In HTML, I used semantic elements like header, nav, section, and footer to enhance readability and accessibility. The navigation menu was created using ul and li elements, styled with CSS for a clean and responsive design.

For styling, I utilized multiple CSS properties such as flexbox for layout alignment, grid for structuring sections, and media queries to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes. I applied custom fonts, colors, and background images to enhance the aesthetic appeal. Buttons and hover effects were implemented using CSS transitions and pseudo-classes, making the user experience more interactive.

By combining these techniques, I successfully created an engaging and well-structured website that effectively showcases the taco shop. You can explore the shop, check out the menu, and get a feel for the place.
